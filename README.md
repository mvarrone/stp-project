## Spanning tree protocol (STP)

## Quick demo

There is a short [video](https://youtu.be/KiXUNJQdU80) to demonstrate the actual progress of the project

We can see project is able to represent a STP tree based on nodes and edges, allowing to show/hide blocked links between devices. Also, in that video, we are changing explicitely the root bridge to SW2 to show a new tree.
